## 📋 Overview

This repository documents my learning journey as a full stack web developer. It includes an organized collection of notes, key concepts, code examples, and small practice projects.

Besides documentation, the repo also contains a minimal **full stack example**:

- A **React** frontend created with Create React App in `frontend/interface`.
- A simple **Node.js** backend in `backend/nodejs`.

The goal is to facilitate learning, experimentation, and serve as a reference for other developers following a similar path.

## ✨ Features

- Key programming concepts and definitions.
- Basic frontend and backend examples.
- Code snippets and experiments.
- Dedicated folder `03-ejercicios` for practicing programming logic through small exercises.
- Roadmap and learning resources.
- Space to grow into more advanced full stack and AI-related topics.

## 📂 Repository Structure (high level)

- `frontend/interface` – React frontend example.
- `backend/nodejs` – Simple Node.js HTTP server example.
- `03-ejercicios` – Collection of small exercises to practice programming logic.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Frontend**
  - React (Create React App) – located in `frontend/interface`
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- **Backend**
  - Node.js (HTTP server) – located in `backend/nodejs`
  - Utility libraries: `lodash`, `dayjs`, `colors`, `nodemon`

- **Other**
  - JavaScript & Python for general exercises and concepts

*(Databases and infrastructure will be added as the learning path progresses.)*

## 📦 Installation and Usage

This repository is mainly for learning and reference, but you can run the example frontend and backend locally.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jairprime/full-stack-web-developer-ai.git
cd full-stack-web-developer-ai
```

### 2. Run the Node.js backend (example)

```bash
cd backend/nodejs
npm install        # if you add a package.json with scripts
node server.js     # simple HTTP server on port 3000
```

The backend will respond on `http://localhost:3000` with simple routes like `/` and `/about`.

### 3. Run the React frontend

```bash
cd frontend/interface
npm install
npm start
```

The React app will run in development mode, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

> As you expand this project, you can connect the React frontend to API endpoints, add databases, authentication, and AI-related services.

## 📚 Basic Concepts

### Programming Fundamentals

#### 🔄 Refactoring
> Changing the internal structure of code without altering external behavior.

#### 📦 Variables
> Containers that store information in the computer's RAM memory.

- **Undefined**: Variable created but not assigned a value
- **Naming conventions**:
  - `UpperCamelCase` - For classes
  - `camelCase` - For functions and variables
  - `snake_case` - For constants or some configurations

#### 🧩 Data Types

| Primitives (Direct assignment) | Referential (Point to memory) |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| ▪️ Number                       | ▪️ Arrays                         |
| ▪️ String                       | ▪️ Object                         |
| ▪️ Boolean                      | ▪️ Functions                      |
| ▪️ Undefined                    | ▪️ Classes                        |
| ▪️ Null                         |                                  |

#### 🔄 Dynamic Typing
> The type of a variable is automatically determined at runtime.

- `typeof` - Operator that returns the data type of a variable

### Frontend Concepts

*(This section will be expanded as you learn more frontend concepts.)*

- **JavaScript fundamentals**
- **React basics (components, props, state)**
- **Styling (CSS, component-based styling)**

### Backend Concepts

*(This section will be expanded as you learn more backend concepts.)*

- **Node.js runtime**
- **HTTP servers and routing**
- **REST APIs**
- **Databases and ORMs (to be added)**
- **Security basics (auth, validation, etc.)*
